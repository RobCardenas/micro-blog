# Project 0 - Microblog

## Summary

Imagine you want to let people write really short public blog posts. The homepage of your microblog app should be a list of these micro-posts with a form to add a new one.

1. Using OOP, jQuery, Underscore.js, bootstrap and some custom styling, I made a basic template where users can add posts to the page where they can share their hiking experience and adventures. 
2. Using bootstrap modal and form elements, users can opt to submit posts to be featured on the page.
